# About Dan Henrie

I have been in the construction industry for twenty years where I started as a laborer and moved my way up to Superintendent. My first real construction job was working for a concrete forming company who specialized in horizontal shoring. After four years and moving up from labor to carpenter, I knew I wanted to get on larger projects and work for a general contractor who also self-performed the concrete, so I applied and got a job as an apprentice carpenter and worked on the Assembly Hall project, from there it was all uphill. I would go onto the next job (Main Street Parking Garage) as a lead carpenter. Next stop was in Vail Colorado, working on the Ritz Carlton Hotel as a foreman. Half way through that project, I started and finished the Ritz Clubhouse as a General Foreman. Over the next few years I would travel around going to jobs that "needed help" with schedule or budget issues. The first opportunity I was given as a Superintendent was on the exterior skin of a mountain resort job which lead to moving around from job to job running exterior skins. Even though I didn't mind working on exteriors, what I really enjoyed was running the concrete crews. So my next chance came on the Church History Library, followed by the Outpatient Pavilion. Then, onto one of my favorites... Tower 5 (The Regent @ City Creek Center). 

​Currently I am a Safe Productivity Coach, where I work with all the self performed crews on multiple jobs manage over 50 General Foreman/Foreman and 0ver 300 leads, carpenters, apprentices and concrete finish crew.

Responsibilities include tracking and managing production cost, creating teams, planning and coordination of all self-performed work. As well as developing the General Foreman, Foreman and leads to run multiple crews. Effectively planning and coordinating their work, sub-contractor coordination, form work efficiencies, material procurement etc.
