I have been in the construction industry for twenty years where I started as a laborer and moved my way up to Superintendent where I successfully completed projects like City Creek Center managing over 450 people which included my companies self-performed concrete crews and subcontractors over the creeks, cascades, retractable roof and skylight system, pavers and landscape on both blocks. Now as coach for the self-performed crews I manage over 50 General Foreman/Foreman and 0ver 300 leads, carpenters and finishers.

Recognizing the limitations for ongoing training and available technologies/materials in our industry, I knew this was something that would be self-taught. In my career I have been extremely successful in meeting budget and schedule expectations and trying to keep pace with technology.  I have worked to help leaders grow and develop their leadership and management skills. I help them to identify, define and simplify their current processes, resulting in improved efficiencies and lower unit cost. You can always find wasted steps in a process; you just have to know what to look for.  I have seen first hand the impact good leaders and teacher's have on one's career. This has motivated me to help people set and reach their chosen career path in the construction industry.
